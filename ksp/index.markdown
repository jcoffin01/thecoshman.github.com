#KSP is awesome!

Yeah, the game is great right out of the box, but you know what, mods can make it even more awesome!
This is going to be the formation of a 'mod pack' of sorts.
I will colate a collection of mods that I think are great, and where permission permits, bundle them together into one download.
Either way, I shall of coruse be linking to the authors main page.
If you feel there is a paticular mod I am not using but fits right in with what I seem to like, please do let me know.
Whilst I get this sorted, I suggest you take a look at [this mod index](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55401-Community-Mods-and-Plugins-Library) on the KSP forums.

I intend to put up a full list of mods I use, and a short description of them, but for now I will mention just one; Remote Tech!
This mod is great! 
basically makes the antenas matter and prevent you from just using probe for everything. 
Wtih this mod your remote probes can only work if the they have a connection back to Kerbal Space Centre, it also rebllances the attenas and adds some more.
You will not be able to just head into space and spam science, you will have to wait for alignment so that your ship can 'see' home to transmit data back.
This really does help address the problem with science at the moment in that you can just spam science.
It also makes solar power more important, long range transmission suck up power really fast, so those gigantic solar panels no longer feel so over the top.
This mod intergrates with the .22 tech tree, unlocking a nice progression of transmiters with more range and better effiecny.
Frankly, it feels like cheating to *not* use this mod!
