#KSP is awesome!

Yeah, the game is great right out of the box, but you know what, mods can make it even more awesome!
This is going to be the formation of a 'mod pack' of sorts.
I will colate a collection of mods that I think are great, and where permission permits, bundle them together into one download.
Either way, I shall of coruse be linking to the authors main page.
If you feel there is a paticular mod I am not using but fits right in with what I seem to like, please do let me know.
Whilst I get this sorted, I suggest you take a look at [this mod index](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55401-Community-Mods-and-Plugins-Library). on the KSP forums
