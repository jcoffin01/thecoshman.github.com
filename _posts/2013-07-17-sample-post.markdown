## My First Post

This is just a sample post to get this fancy pants system tested.

### A start

So, this is an intial start to getting a *fancy* site up and running.

Seems rahter simple so far to use Jekyll to do the clever stuff, leaving posts rather trivial to work with.

### An End?

Well, hopefully this will not end. I like to think I will manage to keep this site going, to quote the race, ever more.

#### raven?

Indeed, standing at my chamber door.

### Sample code anybody?

{% highlight cpp %}
#include <string>
#include "magic.hpp"
#ifdef sample
#endif
template<typename T>
class foo{
        T things;
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight cpp linenos %}
#include <string> // a very long line that will hopefully wrap at some stage though I have no idea how long it will take to get this line to wrap, hopefully I can get It wrap a few times maybe
#include "magic.hpp"
#ifdef sample
#endif
template<typename T>
class foo{
	T things;
}

//was that an empty line?
foo myFoo;
{% endhighlight %}
