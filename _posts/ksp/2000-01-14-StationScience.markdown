This is another mod that adds some science experiments, this time focusing on space stations.
It introduces a new mechanic to the game, you have to build up 'Eurekas' to then use on the actual experiments. 
Sadly this is another mod that does not have proper models in place, instead relying on 'welded parts'.

The the sake of keeping things managable to start with, I am not included this mod. I like the idea of this mod, so perhaps I will reconsider at a later date, especially when it gets proper models for itself.
