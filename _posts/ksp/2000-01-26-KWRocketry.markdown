This is a really nice parts pack. 
I generally would say I am not too keen on just adding new parts to the game, but I gave this a shot and never looked back. 
It provides a whole range of solid boosters, liquid fuel tanks and engines and also fairings.
It integrates well with the tech tree, keeping fairly instep with the existing parts. 
The fairings are particularly nice, and it sure does look better to not have that 'sensitive' science equipment exposed to the riggers of launch.

One thing I would say against it though, whilst it does introduce more 'realistic' parts, it feels a bit like it just completely disregards the existing parts.
The first couple of couple of engines and tanks are just better in more or less every way. 
So perhaps not a 'must have' pack, but still very nice to have.
