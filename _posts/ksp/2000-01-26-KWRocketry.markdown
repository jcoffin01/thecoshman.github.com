This is a really nice parts pack. 
I generally would say I am not too keen on just adding new parts to the game, but I gave this a shot and never looked back. 
It provides a whole range of solid boosters, liquid fuel tanks and engines.
It integrates well with the tech tree, keeping fairly instep with the existing parts. 
The fairings are particularly nice, and it sure does look better to not have that 'sensitive' science equipment exposed to the riggers of launch.

One thing I would say against it though, whilst it does introduce more 'realistic' parts, it feels a bit like it just completely disregards the existing parts.
So perhaps not a 'must have' pack, but still very nice to have, and it does provide some very funky looking parts.

Whilst a great mod, I have chosen not to include this in my pack. It is a rather large mod, so not doing so will help keep the packs size down, but it is also (and I mean no offense here) just more parts. I do not feel these additional parts are needed, as nice as they are.
