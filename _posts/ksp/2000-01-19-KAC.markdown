Are you the sort of person who flies one ship at a time?
Just time warping that one vessel years at a time, whilst the Kerbals back home sit idle.
Don't think it would be better to have many missions ongoing at once?
Problem with doing so is that you end up missing important manoeuvres.
well not any more!
Not only can this alarm clock remind when you a manoeuvre, sphere of influence, apo- or periapsis is close, but it can also save that previous manoeuvre node you spent ten minutes getting just right.
