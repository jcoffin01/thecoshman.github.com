This is a nice simple mod that allows you to switch between VAB and SPH style building.
I find it is mostly usefull when in the SPH and you want to do something with rotational symmetry.
It also probivdes the abbility to do up to 50 way rotational symmetry and control the 'snap angle' to a more usefull values.
There are a few other features that it offers for your ship building, so check out the link.
It is worth remembering that it is the stock editor that limits what you can build, not the game engine itself, this mod just helps remove some of those limitations.
