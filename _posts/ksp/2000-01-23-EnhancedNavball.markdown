The navball is a crucial bit of equipment, with out it, it would be nearly impossible to control ships.
This mod adds some additional details that make it even more crucial.
It adds a few additional markers on the ball, the best one in my opinion is a 'ghost' marker for the manoeuvre node.
No longer will you need to hunt around randomly to line up a manoeuvre, now when the manoeuvre is on the other side of the ball, you get a faint marker at the edge of the ball showing which way to rotate to align with it.

'Software' is GNU GPL, but not sure about the art work, so seeking permision from the author.
