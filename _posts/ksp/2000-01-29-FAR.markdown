It's hard to not understate this mod, it basically completely replaces the stock aerodynamics model. 
You are almost guaranteed to have all of the planes and rockets 'broken' by this mod, but in my opinion it is worth it. 
Everything 'feels' more balanced with this mod.
For example, nose cones actually *help* now! 
It also provides some (optional) enhancements to the SAS and a way to control what flaps are used for (pitch,yaw,roll) that can help prevent wobbling.

The mod author has said he would prefer I do not include it, which is fair enough. 
Like ferram said himself, this reall does change the game. 
So it is up to you, I advise you do get it, and keep it up-to-date (like all mods really).
