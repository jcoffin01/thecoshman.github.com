This is a purely cosmetic mod, and one I do not use out of the box. 
It adds some very beautiful clouds to Kerbin, which just adds so much ambience to the game. 
There is also a night time effect of city lights, but I have chosen to not use this; it just does not feel right to me for there to be these phantom cities that glow at night, but are no were to be seen.

If you are the sort of person who feels mod can ruin the game, this is the mod to prove you wrong. 
Unless of course you like Kerbin looking bland, sterile and with out any interesting atmosphere.
