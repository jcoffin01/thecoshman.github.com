Ok, to be honest, whilst I have this one installed I have yet to get to use in career mode. 
From what I have seen of it from videos, it looks great. 
It introduces the new parts towards the end of the tech tree, so should shouldn't be too hard to work what to do with it.
I do wander what use faster then light travel will be once you have maxed out the tech tree, what science will there be left to get?
That said, perhaps I will look at getting a mod that adds somewhere to go.
As I understand it, unlike most 'wrap drive' style parts packs, this one does not fell over powered, you have work towards getting the very high end engines.
