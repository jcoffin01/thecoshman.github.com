OK, to be honest, whilst I have this one installed I have yet to get to use it in career mode. 
From what I have seen of it from videos, it looks great. 
It introduces the new parts towards the end of the tech tree.
I do wander what use faster then light travel will be once you have maxed out the tech tree, what science will there be left to get?
That said, perhaps I will look at getting a mod that adds somewhere to go in the mean time I could just enjoy exploring the kerbin system.
As I understand it, unlike most 'wrap drive' style parts packs, this one does not fell over powered, you have work towards getting the very high end engines.
