I use this a lot less than I would like.
Early in the tech tree, you will unlock a special part. 
Adding this part to your ship provides an on-board computer through which you can script more or less anything you want.
In theory, you can write a script that can take a satellite from the launch pad to geo-synch orbit; use this three times, a third of an in game day apart and you will have a nice satellite constellation set up in no time.
Like I said, I hardly use this, mostly because I just never get around to writing those scripts, but I still think this mod is great.
