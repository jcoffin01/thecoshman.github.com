A very small mod, just one part, but lord is it nicely made. 
This adds a new experiment to the game, providing a bit more science to be earned. 
I was hesitant at first about adding a new way to get science, fearing it might make it too easy, but this experiment only offers a small amount of science per 'biome', so no worries there.
Factor in how Remote Tech and TAC Life Support make things harder, I feel this experiment is very justifiable.
And did I mention just how nicely made this is?

Awaiting confirmation that the licence covers the artwork too, and man do I hope it does, it is such a grougous but of work.
