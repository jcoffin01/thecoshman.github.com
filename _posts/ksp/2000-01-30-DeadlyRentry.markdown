Yes, the name is right on, you now have to be carefull about how to approach your reentry to Kerbin, or Eve too I would imagine. 
This mod just works so smoothly, and *reallly* does need to be added to the core game  if you ask me. 
Don't let the name fool you, reentry is not a death wish, you just can no longer let your ships drop into the atmosphere at high speeds, say above 3km/s. 
Aim to cut through the atmosphere at say 50 to 60 km and you should be fine, should be.
There are a few aditional parts, heat shields mostly, but everything fits in well, helped by good use of the tech tree.
