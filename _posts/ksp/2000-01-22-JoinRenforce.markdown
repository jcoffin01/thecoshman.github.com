A simple mod that just makes all of the joints between parts much stronger.
Ships will not wobble and snap quite as easily, they still can mind you.

Ferram made this mod too, and has asked that I do not include his mods in packs.
I do advise you add this mod yourself though, it allows your ships to be built with a more reliastic feelnig rigidity.
