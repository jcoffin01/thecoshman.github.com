The stock parachutes in KSP are rather blunt instruments, and not hugely flexible. 
This mod provides three types of parachutes in three mounts each.
Drag-chutes are a new type of parachute, designed for use as your aircraft land to bring them to a halt fast.
The way parachutes work has been reworked to, they now deploy at more sensible heights and deploying gradually so as to not rip off.

A subtle tweak needs to be made to fit better with FAR, a reduction in 'stowed drag', this change has already been in my pack.
