The stock parachutes in KSP are rather blunt instruments, and not hugely flexible. 
This mod provides three types of parachutes in three mounts each.
Drag-chutes are a new type of parachute, designed for use as your aircraft land to bring them to a halt fast.
The way parachutes work has been reworked to, they now deploy at more sensible heights and deploying gradually so as to not rip off.

A subtle tweak needs to be made to fit better with FAR, a reduction in 'stowed drag', this change has already been in my pack.

At the moment, this can be included in my pack. This mod currently reuses existing part models, but has some specialised parts being made. Hopefully those parts will also be ok to include in my pack.
