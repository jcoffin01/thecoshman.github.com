This mod comes in three flavours, all aimed at a offering a ring light that can sit in-line with your rocket, rather than sitting out like the normal lights do.
The first is an amazingly well made part, the second being a lower quality version. 
These are both just one part, offering a lovely blue-white bright light that can illuminate the area around your craft.
The third variant of this mod offers the light in four radial sizes, and more awesomely, a colour picker.
Yeah that's right, you can have your ring light in any colour you could wish for!

I have not yet added it to the pack, as I want to make sure it is set up right.
