Kerbals can no longer live forever surviving of nothing but the fear of imminent explosions!
This mods implements a life support system, you must make sure your kerbals are stocked up on food, water and oxygen before they head out to space.
It also increase the amount of electricity manned capsules use dramatically, to keep the we kerbals warm inside.
Basically, it makes getting kerbals to other planets much harder, and combined with remote tech provides a great balance, kerbals are hard to keep stocked up, but they can always control their ships without satellite links.

Sadly this mod is still using mock part models, but the mechanics are well in place. 
Hopefully soon someone will be able to provide the author with some nice models to use.
In the mean time, a forum user 'regex' has made some [replacement textures](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/40667?p=692832&viewfull=1#post692832), which I have included in my pack.

Just awaitng confirmation about licening regariding the artwork by the author.
