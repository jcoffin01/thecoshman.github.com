This mod does a lot of stuff.
A lot of automation and so on can be done for you.
I use it for just one feature, getting information about dV stat's during ship building.
Some what frustratingly, to get that information requires you have a MechJeb module attached to your ship, but I guess by the time you unlock it, you are still not quite ready for such information.

As I only use it for the dv information it seems silly for me to add this mod to my pack, so I am leaving it out.
