# RESTfull design makes for RESTless thoughts

This will be a series of articles where I talk about what seems to be the most controversial subject in web-design. 
Just what is REST, and what makes a REST api a REST api. 
In an effort to remain impartial, you may find that some articles do not come to any conclusion, just present some thoughts for you to consier.

* What REST isn't
* What is the 'RE'
* And what is the 'ST'
* Basic operations
* More then one resource at a time

That's just a list of subjects I think I will be covering, at some stage.
